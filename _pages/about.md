My name is Zheyuan (Jason) Zhang, a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. My advisor is [Prof. Yanfang (Fanny) Ye](http://yes-lab.org/). Under Prof. Ye's supervision, I collaborate with my [lab mates](http://yes-lab.org/students.html), IBM Research, and [Prof. Chuxu Zhang](https://chuxuzhang.github.io/). Before joining Notre Dame, I received my B.S. degree at Wuhan University (WHU) in 2019 and M.S. degree at New York University (NYU) in 2020. After graduating from NYU, I joined [Coleridge Initiative](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/) as research scientist from 2020 to 2023. My research focuses mainly on threefolds: Agent Optimization, such as Retrivial Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multi-agent Collaboration, Graph Foundation Model, and Recommendation System. I'm also interested in applying AI to solve real life problems, especially in fields of health & nutrition intelligence. For more details, you can find my CV [here](http://JasonZhangzy1757.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
