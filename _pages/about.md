My name is Zheyuan (Jason) Zhang, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, advised by Prof. Yanfang Ye. Before joining Notre Dame, I received his B.S. degree at Wuhan University in 2019 and M.S. degree at New York University in 2020. After graduating from NYU, I joined Coleridge Initiative, Inc. as a research scientist from 2020 to 2023. My research focuses mainly on graph representation learning, natural language processing, and health & nutrition intelligence.
