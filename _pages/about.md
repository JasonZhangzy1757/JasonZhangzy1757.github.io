My name is Zheyuan (Jason) Zhang, a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. I'm supervised by [Prof. Yanfang (Fanny) Ye](http://yes-lab.org/) and [Prof. Chuxu Zhang](https://chuxuzhang.github.io/). Before joining Notre Dame, I received my B.S. degree at Wuhan University (WHU) in 2019 and M.S. degree at New York University (NYU) in 2020. After graduating from NYU, I joined [Coleridge Initiative](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/) as a research scientist from 2020 to 2023. My research focuses mainly on graph representation learning, natural language processing, and health & nutrition intelligence.
